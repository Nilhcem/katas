# FizzBuzz

## Rules

- Print numbers within a given range (i.e.: from 1 to 100)
- Any number divisible by `3` is replaced by the word `Fizz`
- Any number divisible by `5` is replaced by the word `Buzz`
- Numbers which are multiples of both `3` and `5` become `FizzBuzz`.

## Example

```
fizzbuzz(1, 15);

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14

```
